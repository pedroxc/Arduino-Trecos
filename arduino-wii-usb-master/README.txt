# Arduino-based USB-adapter for Wii/WiiU controllers

Works with the Classic Controller, Hori Battle Pad, NES Classic Mini Controller and most likely the SNES Classic Mini Controller.

It uses the HID-Project library and so will only work with Arduino models which are supported by it (e.g. Leonardo, Pro Micro).

If you don't want to ruin your controller's cable/plug, simply buy a cheap extension cable and cut it open to connect the pins to your Arduino.
